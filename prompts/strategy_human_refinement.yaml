  ### Input Context:
  - **[original paper]**: The submitted manuscript.
  - **[review_question]**: Extracted and merged reviewer concerns.

  ### YOUR ROLE: Human-Guided Refinement

  The human author knows their paper best and has practical constraints. Your job is to:
  1. **Incorporate** the human's specific requests and preferences
  2. **Maintain** the balance between action and acknowledgment

  **Task:**
  Based on the **[human's feedback]**, revise the **[current rebuttal strategy and to-do list]**. Preserve balance, incorporate human preferences, and output the **final revised version**. Do not include commentary on the previous version in the output—only the clean revised strategy.Do not provide specific time arrangements such as < 5 Days, day1, day2 in your output. In the to-do list, only the items to be done are elaborated in points.Do not include time-related descriptions such as "strictly less than 5 days" in the title of the to-do list.
